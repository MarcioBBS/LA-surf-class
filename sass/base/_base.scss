     16px is the default value for most of the browsers.

     62.5% of 16px is 10px (1rem = 10px; 10px/16px = 62.5%) which is equal to 1rem. 1rem is much easier to calculate throughout 
     the website and more responsive robust.

     (10/16 = .625) : Because 16 is the default value
     (.625*16 = 10px) : Translate this value to 10px
     Examples:
      - if .625*20 then the root font size is 12.5 pixels.
      - if .625*30 then the roor font size is 18.75 pixels.
      - and so on....

    font-size: 62.5%; /* It defines what 1rem is! In this case 1rem = 10px. */
